Simple game where a blurred picture becomes clearer and clearer. Candidates have to guess what this image means.
I wrote this game for the XP-Days Germany 2010, a conference on agile software development.
The samples here therefor are from general agile context, agile book covers and prominent persons.

Requires modern browser, purely client-side (so no server needed, just open the html file locally).
